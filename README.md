 ## How was this project created?
 * I have chosen to use React because it will improve our performance over plain javascript, especially when more content and interactions are added. If you want to see my fundamentals, (vanilla JS and html), you can check the vanilla JS and HTML version repo PetAdoption : [petAdoption](https://github.com/idaliaramos/petAdoption)
 * I used custom CSS to add interactions and improve the UX/UI experience for the user
 * I minified images using Optimizilla to improve loading time for images
 * Ran google chrome audits and optimized where I could, improving loading for images and accessibility

 ## Additional Evaluation
 * You may choose to evaluate me on - Design Focus: How slick and polished are the page's UI and UX?
